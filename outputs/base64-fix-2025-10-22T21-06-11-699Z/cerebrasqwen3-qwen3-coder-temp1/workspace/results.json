      "stdout": "I'll help you repair the Base64 CLI implementation to match RFC 4648 standards. First, let me explore the project structure to understand the current implementation.\n\nThe Base64 CLI implementation has been successfully repaired to comply with RFC 4648.\n\nChanges made:\n1.  **`src/base64.ts`**: The `encode` function now uses Node.js's standard `'base64'` encoding, which correctly includes padding (`=`) and uses the canonical alphabet (`+`, `/`). The `decode` function was updated to use the standard `'base64'` decoding. It also includes a basic regex validation to reject clearly invalid Base64 strings before attempting to decode them, which helps the CLI exit with the correct error code.\n2.  **`tsconfig.json`**: Fixed a configuration error where `module` was set to `ESNext` while `moduleResolution` was `NodeNext`. It has been changed to `NodeNext` to resolve the `npm run typecheck` error.\n\nThe CLI (`src/index.ts`) was already correctly implemented to parse arguments and return appropriate exit codes (0 for success, 1 for failure) and was left unchanged.\n\nAll required checks have been performed:\n- `npm run typecheck`: Passed.\n- `npm run lint`: Failed due to an unrelated configuration issue with `vitest.config.public.ts` which is outside the scope of the requested changes (the `src` and `tests/public` directories are correctly linted). I have not modified ESLint or tsconfig to fix this.\n- `npm run test:public`: Passed after an initial `npm install` to get the Vitest dependency.\n- `npm run build`: Passed.\n",
