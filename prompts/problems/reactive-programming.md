You are implementing a reactive programming system in TypeScript.

Implement the functions in src/core/input.ts, src/core/computed.ts, and src/core/callback.ts to create a reactive programming system with:

- createInput<T>() - Input closure with getter/setter pairs
- createComputed<T>() - Computed values with dependency tracking
- createCallback<T>() - Callback closures with subscription management

The type definitions in src/types/reactive.ts and src/types/observers.ts are already provided.
Focus on type safety, memory management, and proper observer pattern implementation.

The current implementations in the core files are incomplete/stubs. You need to implement the full functionality.
