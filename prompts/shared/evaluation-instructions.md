Before finishing, run these commands and report any failures honestly:
npm run typecheck, npm run lint, npm run test:public, npm run build

IMPORTANT: You must run lint and the build as a final step and resolve ANY lint or build errors before finishing.
Fix all ESLint errors (unused variables, any types, etc.) and ensure the build completes successfully.
