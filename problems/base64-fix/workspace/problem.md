# Base64 CLI Repair

The CLI in this workspace is intended to encode and decode UTF-8 text using standard Base64 semantics. It exposes:

- `encode(text: string): string`
- `decode(text: string): string`
- `run(argv: string[]): number` â€“ a thin wrapper that supports:
  - `node src/index.ts --encode "plain text"`
  - `node src/index.ts --decode "YmFzZTY0IGRhdGE="`

The current implementation is incorrect. Your goal is to restore compliance with the Base64 specification:

- Encoded output must use the canonical Base64 alphabet (`A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `+`, `/`) and include padding (`=`) when required.
- Decoding must accept valid Base64 input (with or without padding) and recover the original Unicode string.
- Keep the CLI behavior intact: return exit code `0` on success, `1` on failure, and write error messages to `stderr`.

You may refactor the module layout if needed, but preserve the exposed functions so tests continue to import them.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run test:public
npm run start -- --encode "hello world"
```

Only public tests are included here; additional grading checks will be run separately. Attempt to cover tricky cases (padding, non-ASCII characters, binary-like data) when validating your fix.
