# GLM Evaluation Framework Recommendations

## Executive Summary

Based on analysis of current evaluation results and framework development process, this document outlines critical improvements to create a fair, comprehensive model evaluation system that accounts for real-world engineering tradeoffs between accuracy, speed, and cost.

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. Framework Development Bias
The evaluation framework was developed using Codex as the primary debugging partner, creating an unintentional "Codex-native" bias:
- Codex helped identify and work around framework quirks
- Prompts and requirements were refined through Codex iterations
- Error patterns and workarounds became Codex-specific knowledge

### 2. Inconsistent Testing Coverage
- Many evaluation runs only include Codex (especially form-capture tasks)
- Missing data points prevent fair cross-model comparisons
- Framework bugs (lint configs, missing types) penalize models unfairly

### 3. Binary Pass/Fail Limitations
- Current system doesn't account for speed vs. accuracy tradeoffs
- No credit for partial solutions or iterative improvement
- Doesn't reflect real-world engineering priorities

## Recommended Framework Improvements

### 1. Multi-Pass Scoring System

#### Concept
Implement a 3-pass evaluation system with progressive hints and weighted scoring:

```
Pass 1: Cold start (full points for success)
Pass 2: Targeted feedback (70% of full points)  
Pass 3: Detailed guidance (40% of full points)
```

#### Scoring Algorithm
```typescript
finalScore = accuracyScore × passBonus × speedFactor

where:
- passBonus = 1.0 (pass 1), 0.7 (pass 2), 0.4 (pass 3)
- speedFactor = efficiency bonus for faster completion
- accuracyScore = 0-100 based on test coverage
```

#### Speed-Aware Metrics
- **Efficiency Score**: accuracy_score / execution_time_hours
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: accuracy_score / estimated_token_cost  
- **Production Readiness**: weighted combination of accuracy, speed, and consistency

### 2. Progressive Hint System

#### Pass 1: Standard Prompt
```markdown
Complete the task using provided requirements and constraints.
Run: npm run typecheck, npm run lint, npm run test:public
```

#### Pass 2: Targeted Feedback
```markdown
Previous attempt failed on: [specific failure area]
Focus on: [targeted guidance]
Run: npm run typecheck, npm run lint, npm run test:public
```

#### Pass 3: Detailed Guidance  
```markdown
Detailed hints for remaining issues:
- [specific technical guidance]
- [implementation suggestions]
Run: npm run typecheck, npm run lint, npm run test:public
```

### 3. Framework Standardization

#### Configuration Boundaries
```markdown
[OK] Allowed modifications:
- tsconfig.json (for path resolution)
- .eslintrc.cjs (for lint errors)
- Add type declarations (.d.ts files)

[ERROR] Prohibited modifications:
- package.json dependencies/scripts
- Test files
- Core problem requirements
```

#### Sanity Checks
```bash
npm run sanity-check:base64-fix
npm run sanity-check:form-capture
npm run sanity-check:pagination
# Verify each workspace can be built by humans
```

### 4. Problem Diversification Strategy

#### Cross-Pollinated Authorship
- Have each model author problems in their "native style"
- Test all models on all problems
- Creates cognitive diversity, prevents single-model dominance

#### Exercism Integration (Multi-File)
Take Exercism's core logic but wrap in realistic project structure:
```
Before (Exercism): leap.ts (single file)
After (Realistic): 
  src/date/leap-year/calculator.ts
  src/date/leap-year/validator.ts  
  src/date/leap-year/types.ts
  tests/unit/leap-year.spec.ts
  README.md with usage examples
  package.json with scripts
```

#### Task Categories
| Category | Real-World Skill | Example Structure |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Algorithm Implementation | Core logic + CLI | Base64, pagination |
| API Development | Express + DB + Validation | Form capture |
| Tool Building | CLI + Multiple formats | Report builder |
| Code Modernization | Legacy refactor | Add types to old JS project |
| Debugging | Fix broken system | Broken e-commerce site |
| Integration | Connect systems | Payment gateway integration |

### 5. Model Capability Tiers

Based on current results, identify natural capability levels:
- **Tier 1**: GPT-5-Codex (advanced reasoning, multi-file coordination)
- **Tier 2**: GLM-4.6 (capable, but may struggle with complexity)  
- **Tier 3**: Qwen (struggles with multi-file coordination)

This isn't bias - it's reality. Not all models are equally capable.

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Framework Reset (Immediate)
1. Archive current results as "framework development phase"
2. Fix framework technical issues (lint configs, type declarations)
3. Implement sanity checks for all workspaces

### Phase 2: Multi-Pass System (Week 1-2)
1. Modify evaluation runners to support 3-pass system
2. Implement progressive hint generation
3. Create weighted scoring algorithm
4. Add speed and cost tracking

### Phase 3: Problem Refresh (Week 2-3)
1. Create fresh problems using diverse authorship
2. Integrate Exercism concepts with multi-file structure
3. Ensure no model has seen problems before evaluation

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Evaluation (Week 3-4)
1. Run all models on fresh problem set
2. Collect multi-pass scoring data
3. Analyze speed vs. accuracy tradeoffs
4. Generate capability assessment report

## Expected Outcomes

### Fair Model Comparison
- Eliminates framework development bias
- Accounts for different engineering priorities
- Provides nuanced view of model capabilities

### Real-World Relevance
- Evaluates models on scenarios that mirror actual development
- Considers economic factors (speed, cost)
- Differentiates use cases (prototyping vs. production)

### Actionable Insights
- Identifies which models excel at which types of tasks
- Reveals capability gaps and improvement opportunities
- Informs model selection for specific engineering needs

## Success Metrics

### Framework Quality
- All workspaces pass sanity checks
- Consistent build environments across tasks
- Zero framework-related failures

### Evaluation Fairness  
- Each model runs on identical problem sets
- No model has prior exposure to evaluation tasks
- Progressive hints are consistent across models

### Model Assessment
- Clear capability tier identification
- Speed vs. accuracy tradeoff quantification
- Use case recommendations established

## Conclusion

The current framework shows promise but suffers from development bias and limited evaluation dimensions. The recommended multi-pass scoring system, combined with problem diversification and framework standardization, will create a more fair, comprehensive, and real-world relevant evaluation system.

This approach transforms the framework from "which model is most accurate" to "which model is most effective for different real-world scenarios" - providing more valuable insights for practical model selection and usage.
