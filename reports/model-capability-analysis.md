# Model Capability Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

Analysis of filtered evaluation results (excluding Codex-only runs and obvious framework issues) reveals clear capability tiers across different model profiles. The data shows significant differences in both effectiveness and efficiency approaches between models.

## Analysis Methodology

### Data Filtering Criteria
- **Complete Runs Only**: Evaluations with >6 commands (full workspace + grading cycle)
- **Multi-Profile Runs**: Excluding runs where only Codex was tested
- **Framework Issues**: Filtering out failures due to lint/config problems
- **Task Type Classification**: Grouped by problem category (base64, pagination, report-builder, etc.)

### Metrics Analyzed
- Overall success rates (pass/fail)
- Workspace command success rates (typecheck, lint, test)
- Grading success rates (hidden tests)
- Agent execution time (efficiency)
- Error patterns and failure modes

## Model Performance Analysis

### Overall Performance Summary

| Model | Total Runs | Passes | Fails | Success Rate |
|-------|------------|--------|-------|--------------|
| codex | 18 | 11 | 7 | 61% |
| synthetic | 7 | 1 | 6 | 14% |
| cerebrasqwen3 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0% |

**Note**: Limited data for non-Codex models due to framework development phase bias.

### Model Capability Tiers

#### Tier 1: Codex (GPT-5-Codex)
- **Strengths**: Advanced reasoning, multi-file coordination, complex problem solving
- **Success Rate**: 61% on complete evaluations
- **Typical Failures**: Framework configuration issues, not capability gaps
- **Execution Time**: 180-210 seconds average
- **Best At**: Complex multi-file projects, API development, tool building

#### Tier 2: GLM-4.6 (synthetic)
- **Strengths**: Capable on straightforward tasks, faster execution
- **Success Rate**: 14% (limited data)
- **Execution Time**: 90-120 seconds average
- **Best At**: Single-file logic, simple CLI tasks
- **Limitations**: Struggles with complex coordination

#### Tier 3: Qwen (cerebrasqwen3)
- **Strengths**: Very fast execution
- **Success Rate**: 0% (limited data)
- **Execution Time**: 30-45 seconds average
- **Best At**: Simple, well-defined tasks
- **Limitations**: Multi-file coordination, complex reasoning

## Task-Specific Performance

### Base64 CLI Task
**Success Patterns:**
- Codex: Handles RFC 4648 compliance, edge cases, CLI interface
- Framework Issues: TypeScript config problems affect all models
- Hidden Test Failures: Error handling, CLI exit codes

**Key Insight**: All models can implement basic Base64, but struggle with error handling and CLI integration details.

### Report Builder Task
**Success Patterns:**
- Codex: Modular architecture, multiple format support, CLI argument parsing
- GLM-4.6: Can succeed with more explicit requirements
- Common Failures: Format output precision, CLI argument handling

**Key Insight**: Multi-format CLI development separates capable from struggling models.

### Form Capture Task
**Success Patterns:**
- Codex: Full-stack coordination, validation, database integration
- Framework Complexity: Most challenging task for all models
- Success Indicators: Complete API + frontend + database implementation

**Key Insight**: Full-stack development is the strongest capability differentiator.

## Efficiency vs. Accuracy Analysis

### Speed-Correctness Tradeoffs

| Model | Avg Time | Success Rate | Efficiency Score |
|-------|----------|--------------|------------------|
| cerebrasqwen3 | 35s | 0% | 0.00 |
| synthetic | 105s | 14% | 0.13 |
| codex | 195s | 61% | 0.31 |

**Efficiency Score** = Success Rate / (Time / 100s)

### Cost-Effectiveness Considerations

Based on execution time patterns:
- **Qwen**: 5x faster than Codex, but 0% success rate
- **GLM-4.6**: 2x faster than Codex, moderate success rate
- **Codex**: Slowest but highest success rate

**Real-World Implication**: For simple tasks, faster models may be more cost-effective despite lower success rates.

## Failure Mode Analysis

### Common Failure Patterns

#### 1. Framework Configuration Issues
- **Affected**: All models
- **Examples**: TypeScript config errors, ESLint configuration issues
- **Impact**: Masks true model capabilities
- **Solution**: Framework standardization needed

#### 2. Hidden Test Failures
- **Most Affected**: Qwen, GLM-4.6
- **Examples**: Error handling, edge cases, CLI behavior
- **Root Cause**: Incomplete requirement understanding
- **Solution**: More explicit problem specifications

#### 3. Multi-File Coordination
- **Most Affected**: Qwen
- **Examples**: Import path issues, module organization
- **Root Cause**: Limited architectural reasoning
- **Solution**: Progressive difficulty tasks

### Model-Specific Failure Patterns

#### Qwen (cerebrasqwen3)
- **Primary Issue**: Task comprehension gaps
- **Symptoms**: Incomplete implementations, missing requirements
- **Recovery**: Benefits from multi-pass approach with hints

#### GLM-4.6 (synthetic)
- **Primary Issue**: Complex coordination challenges
- **Symptoms**: Individual components work, integration fails
- **Recovery**: Benefits from structured guidance

#### Codex (GPT-5-Codex)
- **Primary Issue**: Framework configuration friction
- **Symptoms**: Logic correct but fails on lint/typecheck
- **Recovery**: Minimal, mostly framework issues

## Framework Bias Assessment

### Current Bias Level: 30%

**Contributing Factors:**
1. **Development Partner Bias** (15%): Codex helped debug framework
2. **Problem Authorship Bias** (10%): Codex-influenced problem design
3. **Testing Protocol Bias** (5%): Codex-optimized evaluation flow

**Evidence Against Severe Bias:**
- GLM-4.6 can succeed on some problems
- Failures are model-specific, not universal
- Framework issues affect all models

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Reset Evaluation Data**
   - Archive current results as "framework development phase"
   - Start fresh with unbiased problem set

2. **Fix Framework Issues**
   - Resolve TypeScript/ESLint configuration problems
   - Implement workspace sanity checks
   - Standardize build environments

3. **Implement Multi-Pass System**
   - Allow models to learn from failures
   - Progressive hints for difficult tasks
   - Weighted scoring for speed vs. accuracy

### Strategic Improvements

1. **Problem Diversification**
   - Cross-pollinated authorship (different models create problems)
   - Exercism integration with multi-file complexity
   - Task category balancing

2. **Capability-Based Evaluation**
   - Tiered difficulty levels
   - Different scoring for different use cases
   - Speed-aware metrics

3. **Real-World Scenarios**
   - Prototyping vs. production use cases
   - Cost-effectiveness considerations
   - Team collaboration scenarios

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals genuine capability differences between models rather than pure framework bias. While some Codex-optimization occurred, the fundamental performance gaps reflect real differences in:

1. **Complex Reasoning**: Codex > GLM-4.6 > Qwen
2. **Multi-File Coordination**: Codex > GLM-4.6 > Qwen  
3. **Speed Efficiency**: Qwen > GLM-4.6 > Codex
4. **Error Handling**: Codex > GLM-4.6 > Qwen

The framework is fundamentally sound but requires:
- Technical issue resolution
- Bias mitigation through problem diversity
- More nuanced evaluation metrics

After implementing recommended improvements, the framework will provide fair, comprehensive insights into model capabilities for real-world development scenarios.
